# T test
# To check the significane between only two groups 
# Now I have two groups
# what should I have to perform T test
# 1- two group 
# 2- two means
# Is there a signficant difference between the two groups?

# 
# what are the types of T test?
# Independent samples t-test (unpaired): This is used to compare the means of two independent groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them.
#Paired samples t-test: Also known as a dependent samples t-test, this is used when the same group of subjects is measured twice, resulting in pairs of observations that are related.
#One-sample t-test: This test is used to compare the mean of a single sample to a known value or a hypothesized population mean.

# Two-way ANOVA

# # Two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to analyze 
# # the effects of two categorical independent variables (factors) on a continuous dependent variable. It allows you to simultaneously examine the main effects of each independent variable as well as any interaction effects between them.
# The null hypotheses for a two-way ANOVA are:
#   
#   There is no main effect of Factor A.
# There is no main effect of Factor B.
# There is no interaction effect between Factor A and Factor B.
